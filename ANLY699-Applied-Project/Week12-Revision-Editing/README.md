## Required Reading

📄 **Primary Resource**: `../APA7/AI4Research.pdf` (Focus on AI-assisted writing)

## Tutorial Content

### 1. Revision Strategy: Multiple Passes

Don't try to fix everything at once. Use systematic passes:

#### Pass 1: Structure and Content (Global)

**Questions to ask**:
- Does the Introduction build a logical argument?
- Are all hypotheses clearly stated?
- Does the Method provide sufficient detail for replication?
- Do Results address each research question?
- Does Discussion interpret all major findings?
- Are sections in logical order?

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Clear research questions/hypotheses
- [ ] Adequate literature support
- [ ] Method details complete
- [ ] Results match research questions
- [ ] Discussion interprets all findings
- [ ] Limitations addressed
- [ ] Conclusions justified

#### Pass 2: Paragraphs and Flow (Meso)

**Questions to ask**:
- Does each paragraph have one main idea?
- Are paragraphs ordered logically?
- Do transitions connect ideas smoothly?
- Is there unnecessary repetition?
- Are examples and evidence sufficient?

**Paragraph structure check**:
```
✅ Good paragraph:
- Topic sentence (main idea)
- Supporting sentences (2-4)
- Evidence/examples
- Concluding/transitional sentence

❌ Poor paragraph:
- Multiple unrelated ideas
- No clear focus
- Abrupt topic shifts
```

#### Pass 3: Sentences and Clarity (Micro)

**Questions to ask**:
- Are sentences clear and concise?
- Is word choice precise?
- Are there grammar/punctuation errors?
- Is tense used correctly?
- Does writing follow APA style?

**Common issues**:
- Wordiness
- Passive voice overuse
- Unclear antecedents
- Run-on sentences
- Sentence fragments

#### Pass 4: APA Style and Format (Polish)

**Check**:
- [ ] In-text citations formatted correctly
- [ ] Reference list complete and formatted
- [ ] Headings use proper levels
- [ ] Tables and figures APA-compliant
- [ ] Numbers formatted correctly (spell out <10)
- [ ] Statistics reported with proper symbols
- [ ] Page numbers and running head (if required)

### 2. Common Writing Issues

#### Wordiness

❌ **Wordy**:
> "Due to the fact that customers who use the platform with high frequency tend to report higher levels of satisfaction, it can be concluded that usage patterns may potentially be related to satisfaction outcomes."

✅ **Concise**:
> "High-frequency users reported higher satisfaction, suggesting usage patterns relate to satisfaction."

**Common wordy phrases**:

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| due to the fact that | because |
| in order to | to |
| at this point in time | now |
| in the event that | if |
| a majority of | most |
| it is possible that | possibly / may |
| has the ability to | can |
| make an assumption | assume |
| conduct an investigation | investigate |
| in spite of the fact that | although |

#### Passive Voice

**When to use passive**:
- Actor unknown or unimportant
- Emphasizing action over actor
- Describing procedures in Method

❌ **Unnecessary passive**:
> "The survey was completed by participants."

✅ **Active**:
> "Participants completed the survey."

✅ **Appropriate passive** (Method section):
> "Data were collected between March and April 2025."

#### Unclear Pronouns

❌ **Ambiguous**:
> "Smith and Jones (2023) examined satisfaction. Chen (2024) replicated their study. This showed consistent results."

What does "this" refer to? The replication? The original study? The entire line of research?

✅ **Clear**:
> "Smith and Jones (2023) examined satisfaction. Chen (2024) replicated their study. Chen's replication showed consistent results."

#### Faulty Parallelism

❌ **Not parallel**:
> "The survey assessed satisfaction, usage patterns, and how long customers had accounts."

✅ **Parallel**:
> "The survey assessed satisfaction, usage patterns, and account tenure."

❌ **Not parallel**:
> "Participants were instructed to complete the survey, returning it within two weeks, and contact us with questions."

✅ **Parallel**:
> "Participants were instructed to complete the survey, return it within two weeks, and contact us with questions."

### 3. Improving Clarity

#### Precise Word Choice

**Vague quantifiers**:
- ❌ "Many participants..."
- ✅ "Seventy-three percent of participants (n = 495)..."

**Vague verbs**:
- ❌ "Satisfaction was related to usage"
- ✅ "Satisfaction positively correlated with usage (r = .47)"

**Ambiguous terms**:
- ❌ "Significant results" (statistically or practically?)
- ✅ "Statistically significant results (p < .001) with large effect size (d = 1.14)"

#### Subject-Verb Agreement

❌ "The data shows that..."
✅ "The data show that..." (*data* is plural)

❌ "The sample of 678 customers were analyzed"
✅ "The sample of 678 customers was analyzed" (*sample* is singular)

❌ "A number of issues was identified"
✅ "A number of issues were identified" (*a number of* = plural)

### 4. APA Style Issues

#### Common Errors

**Numbers**:
- Spell out: 0-9 (except in Abstract, figures, tables)
- Numerals: 10 and above
- Always numerals: statistics, ages, measurements
  - ✅ "5 participants", "3 years old", "measured in 4 intervals"

**Statistics**:
- Italicize statistical symbols: *M*, *SD*, *t*, *F*, *p*, *r*, *R*²
- ❌ "M = 3.47, SD = 0.89, t = 4.52, p = .001"
- ✅ "*M* = 3.47, *SD* = 0.89, *t* = 4.52, *p* = .001"

**Commas in large numbers**:
- Don't use commas: *p* = .001 (not .001)
- Do use commas: *N* = 1,250

**Citations**:
- ❌ "Smith et. al. (2023)"
- ✅ "Smith et al. (2023)" (no period after *et*)

- ❌ "Smith, J. (2023) found..."
- ✅ "Smith (2023) found..." (no initials in text)

**Capitalization**:
- After colon: lowercase unless proper noun or complete sentence
  - ✅ "Two variables: satisfaction and usage"
  - ✅ "One finding stood out: Satisfaction increased with usage."

### 5. Peer Review Process

#### Giving Effective Feedback

**Focus on**:
1. **Global issues first**: Structure, logic, missing content
2. **Then local issues**: Clarity, grammar, style

**Feedback template**:

```markdown
## Overall Impression
[2-3 sentences: What are the main strengths? What's the key contribution?]

## Major Comments

### Strength 1
[Specific positive feedback with examples]

### Strength 2
[Specific positive feedback with examples]

### Area for Improvement 1
[Constructive suggestion with rationale]
*Example*: "The literature review would benefit from organizing thematically 
rather than chronologically. This would help readers see how different 
studies address your research questions."

### Area for Improvement 2
[Constructive suggestion with rationale]

## Minor Comments

### Introduction (lines XX-XX)
- [Specific comment]
- [Specific comment]

### Method (lines XX-XX)
- [Specific comment]

### Results (lines XX-XX)
- [Specific comment]

### Discussion (lines XX-XX)
- [Specific comment]

### Tables/Figures
- [Specific comment about each]

### References
- [Check for completeness and formatting]

## Specific Suggestions

[Line-by-line comments as needed]
- Line 45: Consider revising for clarity
- Line 127: Citation needed
- Line 203: Check this statistic
```

**Dos and Don'ts**:

✅ **Do**:
- Be specific and constructive
- Explain why changes would improve the paper
- Praise strengths
- Suggest alternatives, not just criticisms
- Focus on improving the work

❌ **Don't**:
- Only point out negatives
- Make vague comments ("this needs work")
- Impose your writing style
- Be harsh or dismissive
- Rewrite the paper for the author

#### Receiving Feedback

**How to use reviews**:
1. **Read fully before responding** (emotionally or practically)
2. **Identify patterns**: Multiple reviewers noting same issue?
3. **Distinguish types**:
   - Must fix: Logic errors, missing info, APA violations
   - Should fix: Clarity issues, weak arguments
   - Could fix: Style preferences, minor wording
4. **Address all substantive comments** (explain if you disagree)
5. **Create revision plan** with priorities

**Response to reviewers** (if submitting to journal):

```markdown
We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful feedback. Below we address 
each comment and describe revisions made.

**Reviewer 1, Comment 1**: "The literature review should be organized 
thematically."

*Response*: We agree and have restructured the Introduction accordingly. 
The literature review now addresses three themes: (1) usage-satisfaction 
relationships (pp. 3-5), (2) moderating factors (pp. 5-6), and (3) churn 
prediction methods (pp. 6-8).

**Reviewer 1, Comment 2**: "More detail needed about data preprocessing."

*Response*: We expanded the Data Analysis subsection (pp. 14-15) to 
include specifics about missing data handling, outlier treatment, and 
feature engineering procedures.

### 6. AI-Assisted Writing and Editing

#### Ethical Use of AI (See AI4Research.pdf)

**Appropriate uses**:
- ✅ Grammar and spell checking
- ✅ Improving sentence clarity (with human review)
- ✅ Generating alternative phrasings
- ✅ Checking APA format consistency
- ✅ Identifying passive voice or wordiness

**Inappropriate uses**:
- ❌ Writing entire sections without disclosure
- ❌ Generating fake citations
- ❌ Fabricating data or results
- ❌ Paraphrasing without citing original source
- ❌ Submitting AI text as your own without substantial revision

#### Disclosure

If AI tools substantially contributed:

```markdown
## Author Note

We used ChatGPT (GPT-4) to improve clarity and conciseness of the 
manuscript. Specifically, we input rough drafts of paragraphs and asked 
for suggestions to eliminate wordiness. All final text was written and 
reviewed by the authors. AI was not used for data analysis, interpretation, 
or citation generation.
```

#### Tools and Workflows

**Grammar/Style checkers**:
- Grammarly (free/premium)
- ProWritingAid
- Hemingway Editor (readability)

**R Markdown spell check**:

```r
# In RStudio: Edit → Check Spelling (F7)

# Or use package
library(spelling)
spell_check_files("manuscript.Rmd")

# Add custom dictionary
custom_dict <- c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "churn")
spelling::spell_check_files("manuscript.Rmd", ignore = custom_dict)
```

**AI assistants** (use cautiously):
- ChatGPT/Claude: Clarity suggestions, grammar
- Grammarly Premium: Style and tone
- QuillBot: Paraphrasing alternatives
