## Learning Path

### Step 1: Theory
1. Review the lecture presentation (`02_introDA_1.html`)
2. Understand the three types of analytics
3. Learn about the research process
4. Study variable types and measurement levels

### Step 2: Practice
1. Work through the R tutorial (`02_R_for_DataAnalytics.html`)
2. Run the code examples in RStudio
3. Complete the practice exercises
4. Experiment with the case studies

### Step 3: Apply
1. Complete the lab assignment
2. Practice with your own datasets
3. Apply concepts to real-world problems

## Key Concepts

### Analytics Types
- **Descriptive**: What happened? (Historical analysis)
- **Predictive**: What could happen? (Forecasting)
- **Prescriptive**: What should we do? (Optimization)

### Variable Types
- **Categorical**: Binary, Nominal, Ordinal
- **Continuous**: Interval, Ratio

### Central Tendency
- **Mean**: Average (sensitive to outliers)
- **Median**: Middle value (robust)
- **Mode**: Most frequent

### Dispersion
- **Range**: Max - Min
- **IQR**: Interquartile Range
- **SD**: Standard Deviation

---

## Tools & Packages

### Required R Packages
```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "knitr", "kableExtra"))
install.packages("seedhash")  # For reproducible analysis
```

### Recommended Software
- **R**: Version 4.5.2 or higher
- **RStudio/Posit**: Latest version
- **VS Code**: With R extension (alternative)
